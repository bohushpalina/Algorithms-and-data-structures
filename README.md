# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains solutions to practical tasks from the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course at **BSU**.  
All solutions are implemented in **Java** and organized by topic.

## Structure

- **dynamicprogramming**  
  Solutions for classic dynamic programming problems studied in the course.

- **graphalgorithms**  
  Implementations of graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, shortest paths, etc.).

- **searchtrees**  
  Tasks related to search trees and tree-based algorithms.

- **specialdatastructures**  
  Solutions using special and advanced data structures.

## Purpose

The repository is intended for educational use and course practice, demonstrating correct and efficient algorithm implementations.

## Technologies

- Language: **Java**
- IDE-independent (can be built and run in any Java-compatible environment)
